## Arithmetic Expression Solver Bot Using Speech Recognition in Python
This matkibot will speak with you and calculate the lengthy arithmetical expression. For e.g. if I say "5+4-10*100", It will calculate the answer and tell me.So, we don't need to type the lengthy expression in a calculator(say I want to add 50 different values, I can simply recite which will be type and time consuming) Also, It can search for something which you tell in Wikipedia. So mat+wiki+bot=matkibot.
